		<h2>Hello, stranger.</h3>
		<p>Welcome to my personal website. I have no fucking clue what to put here but here goes nothing.</p>
		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I am a teenage programmer originally from Australia, now residing in Britain. I am diagnosed with what used to be Asperger's syndrome, so that is cool I guess. I have a <a href="https://youtube.com/@zeep-yt">YouTube channel</a> that you should 100% subscribe to for very, very regular (trust) recordings of me geeking out on camera.
		<h3>My Experience</h3>
		 I am quite good at Spigot plugin development, <a href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript">Skript</a>, Linux systems administration and low-level development with C and Assembly. As of writing this, I do not have many projects posted on my <a href="https://github.com/zeeplockd">GitHub</a>, but I may have more while you read this so make sure to check it out.</a>
		 <h3>Anyways,</h3>
		 <p>Thanks for checking out my weird little website I made for some reason. Make sure to stop by again later! Have a good one.</p>
