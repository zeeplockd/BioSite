        <h2>Hello, stranger.</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I’m still figuring out what to put here, but here goes nothing.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I’m a teenage nerd originally from Australia, now residing in Britain. My favourite food is burgers. I joint own with Froggie over at the FrogSMP, a relatively large Minecraft survival server with custom features <span style="font-size: 0.01rem;">s2 when</span>. If you're interested, you can check out my <a href="https://youtube.com/@zeep-yt" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zeeplockd" target="_blank">TikTok account</a> where I occasionally record myself geeking out on camera.</p>

        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        <p>I have experience in multiple languages, mostly Java and Kotlin, web development technologies, Python and Skript/Denizen. I also have some light experience in low level development with C and Assembly. I can also administrate Linux and Windows systems effectively and efficiently, fixing potential security flaws. I am always learning and working on new projects. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/zeeplockd" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to see some of the things I’m working on.</p>

        <h3>Anyways,</h3>
        <p>Thanks for checking out my little site! Feel free to stop by again later. Have a great day!</p>
